# pokesag-docker

A dockerized version of [Pok√©SAG](https://github.com/JoppyFurr/PokeSAG/) by @JoppyFurr!

To run a full stack of `pokesag-docker` (including a database), you can use the following `docker-compose` file.

```yaml
---
version: "3.8"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: pokesag
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pokesag
    volumes:
      - pokesag_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  web:
    image: dmptrluke/pokesag-web:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  server:
    image: dmptrluke/pokesag-server:latest
    environment:
      TZ: Pacific/Auckland
    devices:
      - /dev/swradio0:/dev/swradio0
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    privileged: true
    restart: on-failure
volumes:
  pokesag_db:
```

You can also choose to use an external database by omitting the `db` container and using the `DB_HOST`/`DB_NAME`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASS` environment variables on the `web` and `server` containers.
